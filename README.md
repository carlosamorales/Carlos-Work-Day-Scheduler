## Description

This project is a web-based coding quiz designed to test users' knowledge of JavaScript. The quiz is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface with features such as a timer, multiple-choice questions, scoring, and the ability to save and view high scores.

### What:
The provided JavaScript code implements the logic for a coding quiz. The quiz consists of multiple-choice questions on JavaScript, and it has features such as a timer, scoring, question navigation, and the ability to save initials and scores.

### Why:
The purpose of this coding quiz is to assess the user's knowledge of JavaScript. It follows a set of predefined rules and functionalities, such as starting a timer when the quiz begins, deducting time for incorrect answers, presenting questions one at a time, and ending the quiz when all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero. Users are then given the opportunity to save their initials and scores.

### How:
The JavaScript code achieves this by defining an array of quiz questions with multiple-choice answers. It utilizes event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as starting the quiz, answering questions, saving scores, and viewing high scores. The code dynamically updates the HTML to display questions, answer options, and relevant messages. The timer is implemented using JavaScript intervals, and the scoring system evaluates the user's performance based on correct answers and remaining time. The user's initials and scores are stored in the browser's local storage for future retrieval. The code also includes functionality to reset the quiz and clear high scores.
